➡ Implement as a Python code the algorithm for parenthesis count (stack implementation) that accepts as input an arithmetic expression string having parentheses symbols: ( , ). The Python code will determine if the input arithmetic expression string is valid or invalid by checking if each left parenthesis '(' is paired with a right parenthesis ')'. Use only 1 stack.
<br>
<br>
➡ Implement as a Python code the algorithm to evaluate an input postfix expression with numeric operands. Output the numeric value. Use only 1 stack.
<br>
<br>
➡ Implement as a Python code the algorithm to determine if an input string L is a palindrome string or not. Please see attached the other file for the Palindrome problem.
<br>
<br>
➡ Implement as a Python code the algorithm to convert from Infix to Postfix. Input: Infix expression string whose operands are digits. Output: Equivalent postfix expression string.
<br>
<br>
➡ Write a program to accept as input a string consisting of 1 or more words. Output the same string in which each word is reversed. Use 1 stack to store the letters of each word and use 1 queue to reverse the word stored in the stack.
